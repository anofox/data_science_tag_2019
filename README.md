## Abstract
In many situations it is necessary to make statements about the future. 
To decide whether to build a new power plant in the coming years requires 
predictions about energy demand. If you want to plan your distributors 
in the coming week, you need to predict order behavior. Planning a 
warehouse requires forecasts of demand. Forecasting periods range from 
several years (investments) to a few minutes (IoT monitoring). Regardless 
of the subject context and forecasting periods, forecasts are an extremely 
helpful tool to plan effectively and efficiently. This workshop introduces 
the prediction of R time series and gives an outlook on the use of deep 
learning methods.
